## üîç Overview

**Mini-Enso** is a self-contained AutoHotkey script that automates a sequence of browser profile launches inside **Dolphin Anty**, interacts with VPN extensions, navigates to a target site, mimics human action ‚Äî then retreats. It is **not scalable**, **not modular**, and that‚Äôs the point.

This script is a _minimal functional poem_ about what automation really is: not just execution, but intention.

---

## üß† Philosophy

- **Why AutoHotkey?** Because it's raw. Clunky. Human. It exposes the flow.
- **Why hardcoded positions?** Because Mini-Enso is _not_ about abstraction ‚Äî it's about _contact_.
- **Why the name?** ‚ÄúEnso‚Äù (ÂÜÜÁõ∏) is the Zen circle, drawn in a single stroke. One move. One breath. One function.

This is not a microservice. This is a _manifestation_.

## üîß What It Does

On a loop (every hour), Mini-Enso:

1. Opens Dolphin Anty
2. Sends a scancode to trigger profile search (`/`)
3. Enters profile number (0‚Äì9) via raw scancodes
4. Launches the profile
5. Activates the TunnelBear VPN extension
6. Navigates to `freebitco.in`
7. Scrolls, clicks, waits ‚Äî like a human (but not quite)
8. Logs each action to `enso.log`
9. Closes the browser and moves to the next profile

Every action is deliberate. Every delay has a shape.

## üí¨ Why It Exists

This project is not here to scale. It's here to _reveal_.

Mini-Enso demonstrates:
- Mastery of input-level automation (via raw scancodes)
- Orchestration of GUI without APIs or endpoints
- Behavioral scripting with embedded humanlike patterns
- Architecture under constraint ‚Äî and beyond it

I build behavioral systems, not spambots.  
My agents are resilient. Some even kind.  
This isn't about clicks. It's about cause and effect.
